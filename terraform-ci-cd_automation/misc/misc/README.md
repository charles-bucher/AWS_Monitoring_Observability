⚡ Terraform CI/CD Automation  
**by Charles Bucher | CloudOps Engineer | Automation-First | DevSecOps Focused**

> "If it can be automated, it should be automated. If it can’t, I’ll write a script for it." 💻🔥

---

## 🚀 Overview
This repo demonstrates **full-stack CI/CD automation for Terraform-managed AWS infrastructure**.  
Designed for **hands-on CloudOps engineers** who want **scalable, repeatable, secure deployments** without manual intervention.  

Goal: **Automate Terraform lifecycle from code commit to production**, with validation, security checks, and notifications baked in.

⚡ Quick Start
1️⃣ Clone the repo
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/charles-bucher/Terraform-CI-CD-Automation.git
cd Terraform-CI-CD-Automation
2️⃣ Initialize Terraform
bash
Copy code
cd terraform
terraform init
3️⃣ Run CI/CD pipeline locally
terraform plan → preview changes

terraform apply -auto-approve → deploy

Check logs in CloudWatch or GitHub Actions workflow summary

🧠 Tech Stack
Tool	Purpose
Terraform	Infrastructure as Code
GitHub Actions	CI/CD automation & workflow orchestration
AWS Cloud	Deployment target (EC2, VPC, RDS, S3, etc.)
PowerShell / Bash	Scripts for pre/post-deploy tasks
Slack / Email	Notifications & alerts

🧱 Example Terraform Module Snippet
hcl
Copy code
module "vpc" {
  source = "../modules/vpc"
  name   = "prod-vpc"
  cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

module "ec2" {
  source      = "../modules/ec2"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  subnet_id   = module.vpc.public_subnet_id
}
🛡️ Security & Best Practices
Terraform state files stored in encrypted, versioned S3 buckets

IAM roles & policies follow least privilege principle

Automated CI/CD prevents misconfigurations

Terraform code linting & formatting checks

Secret scanning in workflows

🏗️ Environments
Env	Purpose
dev/	Test new modules & workflows
staging/	QA & validation before prod
prod/	Production-ready deployment
