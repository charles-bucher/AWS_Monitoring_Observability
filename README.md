🌐 AWS Monitoring & Observability





Production-ready observability stack for AWS workloads. Designed for CloudOps, DevOps, and SREs. Centralizes metrics, logs, alerts, and dashboards for multi-tier AWS infrastructure.

Overview
This repository implements a scalable, fully automated AWS observability solution with Terraform, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, SNS, and optional Lambda integration.

Objectives:

Real-time monitoring of infrastructure and applications

Centralized logging for troubleshooting and audits

Automated alerts for operational anomalies

Visual dashboards for actionable insights

Modular Terraform deployment for maintainable infrastructure

Features
Feature	Benefit
CloudWatch Metrics	Real-time compute and storage insights
CloudWatch Logs	Centralized logging for EC2, Lambda, RDS, S3
CloudWatch Alarms + SNS	Automated notifications for critical events
CloudTrail	Audit trail for compliance and security monitoring
Terraform IaC	Modular and reusable infrastructure code
Dashboards	Unified operational visibility
Lambda Processing	Optional custom metrics and event handling

Multi-tier AWS resources feed logs and metrics into CloudWatch

CloudTrail captures all API activity for compliance

Alerts are automatically routed to SNS for notifications

Dashboards provide operational visibility for CloudOps teams

Key Metrics Captured
Resource	Metrics	Alerts
EC2 / Lambda / RDS	CPU, memory, disk, network	Threshold breaches, anomalies
S3 / DynamoDB	Read/write latency, errors, throughput	Data access anomalies, errors
VPC & Networking	Packet loss, latency, traffic volume	Network health alerts
IAM & CloudTrail	API activity logs, changes	Unauthorized access alerts
Technologies
AWS Services: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, SNS, Lambda, S3

IaC: Terraform (modular, multi-environment)

Scripting: Python / Node.js for custom processing

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated deployments

Observability Principles: Metrics, logging, alerting, dashboards, compliance

Terraform Structure
Modules: cloudwatch, sns, cloudtrail, dashboards

Environments: dev, staging, prod

Workspaces: Isolated deployments for reproducibility

Observability Best Practices
Use consistent tagging for resources to improve filtering

Apply least-privilege IAM roles for monitoring tools

Automate log retention and cleanup policies

Test alerts in staging before production deployment

Continuously refine dashboards and alerts based on operational feedback
