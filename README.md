📊 AWS Monitoring & Observability  
**by Charles Bucher | CloudOps Engineer | Automation-First | DevSecOps Focused**

> "If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it." – That’s why every AWS resource here is monitored, alerted, and logged. 🚀

## 🚀 What This Repo Is
This repo is my **hands-on CloudOps playground** for **AWS monitoring, observability, and automated alerting**.  
Everything here is built with **Terraform, CloudWatch, GuardDuty**, and other AWS tools so I can **see, secure, and automate everything in one shot**.  

Think of it like a **command center for AWS**—all metrics, logs, and alerts in one place.
