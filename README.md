🛡️ CloudWatch Sentinel: Proactive Monitoring & Incident Response

Charles Bucher | Level 10 TechOps

This repository demonstrates how to build a robust monitoring and alerting system using AWS CloudWatch and SNS. It focuses on collecting detailed EC2 instance metrics, setting up alarms, and automating notifications to enhance observability and incident response capabilities.

🔑 Key Features

EC2 Metrics Collection: Gathers comprehensive metrics from EC2 instances to monitor performance and health.

CloudWatch Alarms: Configures alarms to detect anomalies and trigger automated actions.

SNS Notifications: Sends real-time notifications to stakeholders upon alarm triggers.

Log Aggregation: Collects and analyzes logs for deeper insights and troubleshooting.

Infrastructure as Code: Utilizes CloudFormation for consistent and repeatable deployments.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Component	Purpose
AWS CloudWatch	Monitoring and observability
Amazon SNS	Notification service

🚀 Project Walkthrough
1. Deploy Resources
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name CloudWatchSentinel --template-body file://cloudformation/template.yaml


This command deploys the necessary resources defined in the CloudFormation template.

2. Monitor Metrics

Utilize CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instance metrics such as CPU utilization, disk I/O, and network traffic.

3. Set Up Alarms

Configure CloudWatch alarms to detect thresholds and trigger actions like sending notifications via SNS.

4. Automate Responses

Implement Lambda functions to automate responses to specific alarms, such as scaling actions or remediation steps.
